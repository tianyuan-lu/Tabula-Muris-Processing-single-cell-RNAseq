# Tabula_Muris_Processing_single_cell_RNAseq
Pipeline for processing and analyzing single cell RNAseq data

Key steps of our analysis are explained below. Please also refer to our manuscript regarding other analyses not online. For technical details please contact Tianyuan Lu (tianyuan.lu@mail.mcgill.ca) or Dr. Jessica C. Mar (j.mar@uq.edu.au).

### Preprocessing
---
Raw counts data can be retrived from the Tabula Muris study at https://github.com/czbiohub/tabula-muris.

These data can be preprocessed by

		Rscript preprocessing.R celltype_annot.tsv

where **celltype_annot.tsv** can be found in the "CellTypeAnnotation" folder. Change "tissue" in line 5 of the script to "Brain"/"Heart" or any other desired tissue.

Gene model ("TM_gene_genomic_info.tsv") of mm10 is based on UCSC genome browser and supplied to the script.

### Imputation
---
Imputation of the filtered data can be performed by the "scImpute" R package.

		scimpute(count_path = "/path/to/filteredfile" 
         	         infile = "csv",           
         		 outfile = "csv",          
         		 out_dir = "/path/to/output/directory",         
         		 drop_thre = 0.5,          # threshold set on dropout probability
         		 Kcluster = number_of_clusters,             # number of cell populations; in our study, 4 for brain cells and 6 for heart cells
         		 ncores = 10)              

Please refer to https://github.com/Vivianstats/scImpute for more instructions. Imputed data have been provided in rds format.

### Normalization
---
Normalization of imputed data can be performed using the following code in R:

		heart <- readRDS("HeartImputed.rds")
		brain <- readRDS("BrainImputed.rds")
		Seuseth <- NormalizeData(object=seuseth, normalization.method="LogNormalize")
		Seusetb <- NormalizeData(object=seusetb, normalization.method="LogNormalize")
		SEUSETH <- FindVariableGenes(object=Seuseth, mean.function=ExpMean, dispersion.function=LogVMR, x.low.cutoff=0.0125, x.high.cutoff=3, y.cutoff=0.5)
		SEUSETB <- FindVariableGenes(object=Seusetb, mean.function=ExpMean, dispersion.function=LogVMR, x.low.cutoff=0.0125, x.high.cutoff=3, y.cutoff=0.5)
		heartHVG <- heart[SEUSETH@var.genes,]
		brainHVG <- brain[SEUSETB@var.genes,]

Loading the "Seurat" R package is necessary. Normalized data are stored in the **Seuseth** and **Seusetb** objects.

### Identification of differential distribution
---
Genes having differentially distributed expression patterns can be identified using the "scDD" R package.

		Rscript scDD.R
	
This script takes in the annotation files in the "CellTypeAnnotation" folder and the imputed and normalized read counts obtained in the last step. Change "celltype" in line 7 & 19 and "tissue" in line 8 accordingly. The outputs are cell type-specific results.

### Gene set variation analysis
---
GSVA can be performed using the R package "GSVA"

		exp <- as.matrix(read.table("expression_matrix", header=T, row.names=1))
		gset <- getGmt("Mus.gmt")
		GSVAresult <- gsva(exp,gset)

where the "Mus.gmt" describing gene sets has been provided.

### PANDA network
---
Construction of PANDA network ensembles can be achieved step by step.

1. Remove genes on sex chromosomes and get genes documented in TF-gene motifs.

2. Separate samples by condition, which in our study is gender:

		python3 heart_separate_gender.py
		python3 brain_separate_gender.py

Please prepare required imputed, normalized, sex-chromosome-removed and motif-matched counts data and corresponding annotation files.

3. Prepare samples for PANDA network ensemble by Jack-knife method

		python3 heart_random_split.py
		python3 brain_random_split.py

Required files have been provided.

4. Constructing PANDA networks using PANDA scripts in Matlab.

Please refer to https://sites.google.com/a/channing.harvard.edu/kimberlyglass/tools/panda for exhaustive instructions.

Motif files and PPI files have been provided in the "forPANDA" folder.

5. Differentially represented edges, differentially targeting TFs and differentially targeted genes can be tested using

		python3 Edge_t_test.py edges.pairs male_output female_output
		python3 get_out_degree.py PANDA_output
		python3 get_in_degree.py PANDA_output

Edges.pairs files are provided in the "forPANDA" folder for heart and brain respectively. Note that outputs of the first t test have not been adjusted for multiple testing, and this should be done additionally.
